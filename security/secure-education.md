# Secure Education

Rocket.Chat can be deployed by Higher Education providers, schools and similar institutions to address requirements of laws that protect student records such as FERPA and similar. Currently, Rocket.Chat is used by multiple education providers already all around the world.

We provide help for professionals from these institutions to evaluate Rocket.Chat for their needs. The standard to evaluate applications for use in higher education in the US is the Higher Education Community Vendor Assessment Toolkit - or short: HECVAT. 

For more information about HECVAT, check these resources: [https://library.educause.edu/resources/2020/4/higher-education-community-vendor-assessment-toolkit](https://library.educause.edu/resources/2020/4/higher-education-community-vendor-assessment-toolkit)

HECVAT is a thorough evaluation routine that also can be used as a baseline for providers in other countries.

In short:

* Rocket.Chat is HECVAT-ready with a score of 84% of all controls in place. All open controls have a compensating control / explanation added so the true score is higher.
* Rocket.Chat in education is best deployed **self-managed** so you keep full control over your infrastructure while leveraging all of Rocket.Chat´s functionalities.
* Deploy Rocket.Chat via the method of your choice so you can use it within your current infrastructure rather than to build specific infrastructure around Rocket.Chat
* Review Rocket.Chat´s configuration before opening it up to your students. We cannot give a full configuration advice because deployments differ vastly. Still Rocket.Chat has all the configurations you need.

You can **download** a free copy of pre-filled HECVAT questionnaire below to help you with your assessment and accelerate the evaluation process. You can take that pre-filled questionnaire and use the information within to finalize your assessment.
