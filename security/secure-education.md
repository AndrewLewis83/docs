# Secure Education

Rocket.Chat can be deployed by Higher Education providers, schools and similar institutions to address requirements of laws that protect student records such as FERPA and similar.

We provide help for professionals from these institutions to evaluate Rocket.Chat for their needs. The standard to evaluate applications for use in higher education is the Higher Education Community Vendor Assessment Toolkit - or short: HECVAT. For more information, check these resources: [https://library.educause.edu/resources/2020/4/higher-education-community-vendor-assessment-toolkit](https://library.educause.edu/resources/2020/4/higher-education-community-vendor-assessment-toolkit).

You can **download** a free copy of pre-filled HECVAT questionnaire below to help you with your assessment and accelerate the evaluation process. In short: Rocket.Chat is HECVAT ready and best deployed self-managed so you keep full control over your infrastructure while leveraging all of Rocket.ChatÂ´s functionalities.
